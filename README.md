# DungeonChat
DungeonChat is an online platform for tabletop DnD-esque games.

Live Project: [DungeonChat](https://dungeonchat.herokuapp.com/ "Live link at Heroku")

Maybe you're interested in starting an exciting but lengthy campaign with friends, or maybe you're looking to get into tabletop games but don't know where to start, don't have friends to play with, or simply don't have a schedule that makes meeting up with friends possible.  

Enter DungeonChat, an online gaming platform that allows you to create and play your very own campaigns asynchronously, whenever and wherever you want, all online.

DungeonChat gives DM's the ability to create their own unique campaigns/stories while characters can join and play along via a shared chat/channel.  Functionality is built into the chat to roll dice and make decisions about the campaign direction, express character exposition, and even chat with spectators viewing the game.
